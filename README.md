Analysis of Svevoâ€™s letters corpus, machine learning assignment 

# Problem Statement 
Italo Svevo, a pioneer of the psychological novel in Italy and one of the greatest Italian novelists, wrote and received letters in multiple languages during the twentieth century. The letters were recorded and stored in a database. Thus, the purpose of this project is to analyze those epistolary corpora to gain insight into topics and sentiments expressed (positive or negative) in his letters. This approach intends to extract information from the corpora by looking at the relationships between subjects, people, and emotions, as well as how those interactions change over time.
